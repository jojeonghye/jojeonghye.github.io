  <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <img src="champagnesupernova.jpg" width=500>
  <p>How many special people change
  How many lives are living strange
  Where were you while we were getting high</p>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">
  Slowly walking down the hall<br>
  Faster than a cannon ball<br>
  Where were you while we were getting high
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">
  Someday you will find me <u>caught beneath the landslide</u>
  with a <strong>Champagne Supernova</strong> in the sky

  <h2>We were getting high</h2>
  <h3>We were getting high</h3>
  <h4>We were getting high</<h4>
  <p style="margin-top:50px;">
  'Cause people believe that they're gonna get away for the summer<br>
  But you and I we live and die<br>
  The world's still spinning round and we don't know why<br>
  Why why why why
